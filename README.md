Face Detection Magic 🌟
Welcome to the Face Detection Magic, where we make faces stand out like celebrities on the red carpet! This super cool and funny Python script uses OpenCV's magic wand (Haar Cascade Classifier) to detect faces in images. 🚀✨

Make sure you have the enchanting OpenCV library installed.

         pip install opencv-python

🎉 Features:
###   Detects faces with  precision 
###   Draws sparkly blue rectangles around detected faces.
###   Saves the enchanted image as 'face_detected.png'—ready to be shared.

Happy face detecting! 🌈🔮🎉
